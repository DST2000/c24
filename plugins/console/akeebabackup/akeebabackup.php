/**
 * Temporary workaround due to Joomla 4 extension installer bugs
 *
 * Modern Joomla 4 plugins do NOT have a plugin entry point file with a class following the plgTypeName convention.
 * Instead, they have a Joomla\Plugin\PLUGIN_TYPE\PLUGIN_NAME\Extension\PLUGIN_NAME class which is instantiated by the
 * services provider (plugins/PLUGIN_TYPE/services/provider.php) after registering the PSR-4 autoloader for the
 * Joomla\Plugin\PLUGIN_TYPE\PLUGIN_NAME class prefix.
 *
 * However, this means that the XML manifest can not have a `<filename plugin="PLUGIN_NAME">PLUGIN_NAME.php</filename>`
 * line any more since the PLUGIN_NAME.php file no longer exists. For historical reasons traced back to Mambo back in
 * 2003 that line is, however, how the plugin extension installation adapter determines the "element" (extension name).
 * Due to what seems to be a bug in that class, the alternative of defining an `<element>` tag in the manifest seems to
 * be ignored. Therefore the plugin becomes impossible to install without this line. As a result we need to include this
 * line.
 *
 * However, if we include this line we now need the PLUGIN_NAME.php file to be present. This has two diametrically
 * opposite effects for Joomla 3 and 4.
 *
 * Joomla 3 will now try load this plugin if someone misguidedly included the "console" group of plugins. We can not
 * extend from the namespaced class (which requires Joomla 4) or we'd end up with a PHP Fatal Error.
 *
 * However, Joomla 4 completely IGNORES this file. That's right, it doesn't even bother loading it! This file is
 * considered "legacy" but our plugin already has a services provider. The services provider takes priority and does
 * return an instance of CMSPlugin, therefore the legacy code never kicks in.
 *
 * So, if we just create an empty legacy plugin class in this file we're covered. Joomla 3 won't crash and Joomla 4 will
 * still work.
 *
 * That is why you see this weird empty plugin file here. No, we're not insane, we did not forget to implement the
 * plugin, we are just working around some teething problems in Joomla 4.
 *
 * If you are a Joomla extensions developer reading this: you're welcome, mate â€” maybe buy me a coffee? :D
 *
 * @since 7.5.1
